# Project Structure
---
This is just a very rough idea but the content of the file can read and look something like this for now and we can change it as we go:

- com.MasterHash
	- .gui - Contains all the screens
		- Welcome.java - The main screen when the application is launched.
		- Home.java - Once the user is logged in they will be able all there logins.
		- NewLogin.java - Where the user can create new logins.
		- Table.java - Where the user can add a new username, password and name or get the username, password or name.
	- .security
		- File.java - Used to generate a new file.
		- NewPassword.java - Used to generate new passwords for logins.
		- Decrypt.java - Used to decrypt the file.
		- Encrypt.java - Used to encrypt the file.
